Flamingo Swap is Flamingoâ€™s on-chain Auto Market Maker (AMM), providing liquidity to wrapped assets, FLM, and other NEP-5 based tokens. Swap adopts the Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) model, which was popularized in many AMM-based DEXs, such as Uniswap. CPMMs are based on a function that establishes a range of prices for two tokens according to the available quantities (liquidity) of each token. Within Swap, users can trade token pairs (included in a whitelist at the early stage) or provide liquidity to a chosen liquidity pool by depositing tokens to provide equal liquidity on both sides of the trading pair.
